# FastLED-LSU-Patterns
This Arduino sketch is designed to display LSU patterns of lights on a NeoPixel-style (3-pin) LED strip using the FastLED library. 
## Alternating
Purple and gold are displayed every other LED and alternate color.
## Chase
Purple or gold is displayed down the entire LED strip animated from beginning to end
## Crossfade
Fades from purple to gold and back to purple across the entire LED strip
## Solid
Fades a color provided as an argument from on to off and back on
## Confetti
Based on confetti in DemoReel100, blinks pixels on and fades off.
## Wave
Runs a sine wave up and down the strip, changing the color when the wave reaches the far end of the strip
